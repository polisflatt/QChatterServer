*QChatterServer, version 1.0*

QChatter is a free method of textual communication between two or more parties. QChatter does not attempt to compete with any other service or method of communication; however, it tries to emulate very important facets of a modern textual communication program.

This repository mainly includes the source code for the back-end of QChatter, which is made in PHP--and can be ported to different languages with dedication.


To host you need:

 - PHP 7
 - Apache or any HTTPD that allows for denying of directories and can run PHP
 - GNU/Linux, BSD, or any variants
 - A mind poised for random errors within the server (for now)
 
 You must place QChatterServer into a directory, of which your HTTPD is hosting. You must then create a **channel** and **user** folder in the directory that QChatterServer is in. This is required.

Then, get your QChatter client, and connect. I'm hosting a server at http://teamweflatt.ddns.net/QChatter/QChatterServer/


Right now, this program is:

 - Sloppy
 - Unorganized
 - Unclear, ambiguous, enigmatic
 - Unprofessional
 - Prone to errors
 - Lacking of proper implementation of things
 - Devoid of a proper database system
 
 QChatter doesn't use a database, and it never will for some things. I thought to myself, "Why have everyone in some big file that gets bloated quickly?" and I turned out to like this idea, but the absence of a proper database is mostly due to the fact that I am to lazy to learn an SQL language.

This is probably the most ambitious of my various programming projects, and I don't know where this will go.
