# Changelog 

## 12-31-18
Added commands along with plugins. No documentation is avaliable right now.

Also changed the way you receive messages. This time, instead of lazily (and in a facile manner) getting messages via new lines, we can get them individually thanks to JSON arrays.
This means we have multiline messages now!
