# Changelog

Added commands along with plugins. No documentation is avaliable right now.

Also changed the way you receive messages. This time, instead of lazily (and in a facile manner) getting messages via new lines, we can get them individually thanks to JSON arrays.
This means we have multiline messages now!

Inital release. This had been a side project of mine for about a month and a half, and I'd gotten pretty far--relatively. I wanted to release not to show off, but to see if I could receive help via free contributions. I also wanted this program to be avaliable to people who: want to use it, want to modify it, want to distribute it, while keeping the source code readily avaliable. So, I chose the GPL v3 license, and I am hoping that was the right choice to make.
